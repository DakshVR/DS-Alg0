#! What is a Graph.
#  Graph consists of a finite set of Vertices(or Nodes) and set of Edges which connect a pair of nodes.

#! Why we need Graph.
#  It used to represent networks: path in city, circuit.


#? Terminology
#  Vertices(Vertex): Vertices are the nodes of the graph.
#  Edge: The edge is a line that connects pairs of vertices.
#  Unweighted graph: A graph which does not have a weight associated with any  edge
#  Weighted graph: A graph which has a weight asscoiated with any edge.
#  Undirected graph: In case the edges of the graph do not have a direction associated with them.  
#  Directed graph: If the edges in a graph have a direction assocated with them
#  Cyclic graph: A graph which has at least one loop
#  Acyclic graph: A graph with no loop
#  Tree: It is a special case of directed acyclic graph

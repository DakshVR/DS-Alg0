# Data Structures and Algorithms

**Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms repository!** 
This repository contains comprehensive implementations of various data structures and algorithms in Python. It serves as a personal project to deepen my understanding and as a resource for anyone interested in learning about these fundamental concepts.

## Data Structures
The repository covers the following data structures:

- **Arrays**
- **Lists**
- **Dictionaries**
- **Tuples**
- **Linked Lists** (Singly Linked Lists, Circular Singly Linked Lists, Doubly Linked Lists, Circular Doubly Linked Lists)
- **Stacks**
- **Queues**
- **Recursion**
- **Trees** (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees, etc.)
- **Heaps** (Min Heap, Max Heap)
- **Trie**
- **Graphs**
- **Hash Tables**

Each data structure has its folder containing:
- A Python implementation

## Algorithms

The repository also includes various algorithms, such as:

- **Sorting Algorithms** (Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Bucket Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, etc.)
- **Searching Algorithms** (Binary Search, Linear Search, etc.)
- **Graph Algorithms** (Dijkstra's Algorithm, Bellman Ford Algorithm, etc.)
- **Dynamic Programming**
- **Greedy Algorithms**
- **Backtracking**

Each algorithm has its folder with: 
- A Python implementation

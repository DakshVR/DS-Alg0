#! Minimum Spanning Tree
#?  A minimum spnaning tree (MST) is a subset of the edges of connected, weighted and undirected graph which:
#*      Connects all vertices together
#*      No cycle
#*      Minimum total edge

#? Real life problem
#  Connecte 5 island wirh bridges
#  Cost of the bridges between island varies based on different factors
#  Which bridge should be constructed so that all island are accessible and the cost is minimum

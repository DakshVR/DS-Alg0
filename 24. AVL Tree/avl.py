#* What is an Avl tree?
#  AVL tree is a self-balancing Binary Search Tree (BST) where the difference between heights of the left and right subtrees cannot be more than one for all the nodes.

# All properties of BST applies to AVL.
# Additional property, the tree must be balanced, making BST balanced.

# If at any time heights of left and right subtree differ by more than one, then rebalancing is done to restore AVL propery, this process is called ROTATION.

#* Why we need Avl tree?
